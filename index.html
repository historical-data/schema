title: Historical and Genealogical MicroData
---

<h1>What is historical-data.org?</h1>

<p>This site defines a collection of schemas (applied in the form of HTML tags) that webmasters 
can use to markup their historical and genealogical information in a consistent way.</p>

<p>Many sites are generated from structured data, which is often stored in databases. When this data is 
formatted into HTML, it becomes very difficult to recover the original structured data. Many applications, 
especially search engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data. On-page 
markup enables search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide richer search 
results in order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web. Markup can also enable 
new tools and applications that make use of the structure.</p>

<h2>Date Note</h2>

<p><a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a>, and 
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/md/">Microdata</a> all rely on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 
8601</a> date format, which cannot support approximate dates. Review the Library of Congress's 
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/">Extended Date and Time Format</a>, which extends ISO 8601 and 
allows uncertain and approximate dates.</p>
